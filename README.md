# CheapBuyWebStore
 This is a full webpage CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) project containing a Next.js 14 React App, a .NET 8 API and SQL Server as relational database.
 
 The main page displays a list of Products. We are able to edit, delete and add new products.

The add/edit pages we can type the id, name, select a brand and a price (integer only).

On the API side, we have 6 endpoints, 1 to get all the brands and 5 to manipulate the Product.

I'll try to keep it up-to-date with latest Next.js and .Net versions.
